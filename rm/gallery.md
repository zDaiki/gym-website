## About The Image Gallery Project

This project was built using HTML, CSS (and CSS Grid for the responsive grid), and vanilla JavaScript for the filtering system.

The photos used in the gallery were taken from me.

## ImageKit for Image Compression

All images used are compressed with [ImageKit.io](https://imagekit.io/).
